        <p>
          The FIRA RoboWorld Cup is an esteemed international robotics
          competition, established in 1996, that encompasses various robotic
          soccer competitions and other robotic challenges. This annual event,
          hosted by different countries each year, aims to advance robotics
          technology through competitive and cooperative team activities,
          fostering innovation in robotics, artificial intelligence, and related
          fields.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Participants at the FIRA RoboWorld Cup are at the forefront of
          technological innovation, often developing new algorithms, sensors,
          and hardware to enhance their robots' performance. The competition
          bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical
          application, making it a fertile ground for technological
          advancements.

        <h1>Health Assistant H-Sit (Healthy Sitting)</h1>
        <p>
          EyeBo is proud to introduce the C11 AI team, a dedicated group within
          our company addressing common health issues arising from prolonged
          computer and mobile phone use, such as body hunching and neck bending.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          The H-Sit smart application leverages artificial intelligence and
          advanced image processing technology to monitor and improve users'
          posture in real-time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The system alerts users to correct their posture when a non-standard
          position is detected, helping prevent long-term health problems
          associated with poor posture.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img class="about-pic" src="pic4.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Additionally, H-Sit records user performance, generating detailed
          reports that provide insights into posture habits.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These reports enable the program to suggest personalized corrective
          actions and include training exercises to help users improve their
          posture over time. Users can track their progress and see tangible
          improvements through continuous feedback.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In today's digital age, the C11 team's solution is essential for
          enhancing comfort, productivity, and long-term health and well-being.

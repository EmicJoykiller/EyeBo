I developed a cutting-edge website for Eye Bo AI, a startup focused on revolutionizing sitting posture tracking through advanced AI technology. The website's design prioritizes a seamless user experience with a visually striking and highly interactive interface. I employed modern front-end development techniques, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, to create a fully responsive layout that adapts flawlessly across all devices. Utilizing frameworks like React for dynamic content rendering and incorporating responsive design principles, the site ensures optimal accessibility and performance.

I also integrated version control through Git and GitHub, enabling efficient collaboration and continuous deployment. The website highlights Eye Bo's innovative AI product through engaging visuals, intuitive navigation, and a user-centric approach. My focus on clean, well-documented code and adherence to best practices in web development ensures the site's maintainability and scalability, reflecting my expertise in delivering high-quality digital solutions.
